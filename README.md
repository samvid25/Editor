# Editor

Editor is a simple word processing application built using the ElectronJS framework. It supports most basic text editing features.

## Usage
Editor requires ElectronJS to run. You can get it from [here](https://electron.atom.io/). 

To install all the required node dependancies:
```
$ npm install
```

To run the app:
```
$ electron .
```

Once the app is completed, I will make a standalone executable.


## To Do

- Add text highlight feature.
- Add save feature. ('save as' already implemented)
